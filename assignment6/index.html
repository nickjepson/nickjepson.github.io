  <p>
    Troops were needed to be increased by over 100 percent from 1956 to 1957. The reason behind this increase was the Suez Crisis in the 1950s, causing many troops to be deployed to Egypt. Then, in Kenya, a communist uprising was happening, which the U.S did not want to happen, especially during this era. Other uprisings in Zambia and Ghana were also occurring at the time, so there needed to be an increase in those places, too.
