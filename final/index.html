            	The movie, “42,” does a great job at showing the perseverance, strength, and courage of Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play Major League Baseball. He defeated the stereotypes, overcame the racism, and established himself as one of the greatest to ever play the game, regardless of skin color. The story shows the racial hegemony in Major League Baseball at the time, and how that affected players like Jackie. Jackies defies those odds and pushes those owners away from this oppression. “42” shows great examples of how racial hegemony was back in the 1940’s, and how Jackie challenged that status quo.
However, the movie, “42,” also lacks in depicting this hegemony. Because we only focus on Jackie Robinson and not any other black athletes from that time, there is not a great presence of knowing what would happen in a situation that was not Jackie. This forces the viewer to see not the progression and defeating of racial stereotypes, but they see a black person with high character, so he deserves that role. It fails to accurately show the injustice faced all over, and what Jackie did for the sport of baseball as a whole, not just for himself. This still represents the overcoming of these racial stereotypes and racist laws, but it is incomplete in showing us the whole story in that sense. It still seems to me that baseball was still dominated by white people, and still practically is now. So the way the movie frames it as a one-man story does not quite show if that hegemony was eradicated or if he was an anomaly. In the Kim and Na reading, the power of embracing progress is established as powerful at the Olympics. But this case suffers the same flaws as the “42” film in regards to hegemony. The community is ignoring the longstanding control by a group of people, and simply saying “we are all together,” even though they are not. 
The framing of the movie “42” presents some issues as well. Specifically, when we look at the role of Branch Rickey, we see him as the man fighting for Jackie and his rights. While that is a great thing, the way it's framed is not. Rickey seems to be the “hero” in this case, but in reality, the years of black people’s fight against racism was what helped Jackie become who he was. It dismisses some of America’s past and reframes it into a realization moment, making it look less bad for white people. In the Kim and Na reading, they show that the Olympic ceremonies are rather similar. Instead of acknowledging the past mistakes and oppressions by countries, against other countries, they promote this peace and unity. Instead, this just pushes these problems to the back burner to be figured out in some other way, most likely violence. The way this movie shapes Rickey as a major factor in Jackie’s success diminishes Jackie’s accomplishments and diminishes the progress made by civil rights at that time. It takes away from the perseverance of black people, and turns it into a white person giving the “O.K.” 
Furthermore, we lack context as to how this shaped the country as a whole. By just attaching onto Jackie’s 1947 season mainly, we do not see what his real impact was on not just Major League Baseball, but in the country. It does not have the amount of depth that is needed to describe and show the outcome of the racial hegemony. We miss the parts where we see improvements off the field, which is the main way this movie lacks in describing hegemony. This is a one-case thing that may not apply to everything else, so losing that context makes it look like things were better, when in reality, things were getting worse in our racially divided country. 
In a sense, the movie “42” does justly cover the racial hegemony of Major League Baseball in the 1940’s, but it lacks in telling a full story of the progression made therefore after. In regards to challenging racial hegemony, Jackie succeeds in his efforts, but we do not see the major impacts of this film being put on display. The framing leads the viewer to not get the full scope of how bad it was, and what Jackie and many others really had to go through. So, it does of course describe the racial hegemony and show it being challenged and defeated, but it does not give the entire impact and further actions get the time it deserved in the movie.
