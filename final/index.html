  <div class="section">
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-6">
            <h2>DRUG OVERDOSES HAVE INCREASED EVERY YEAR. WHY?</h2>
        <div class="written-scroll">
          <p>
            	Over 8.6 million people died of drug overdoses between 2019 and June of 2024. When it comes to the rate, it has seen a jolt in fentanyl and cocaine overdoses from 2022 to 2023. The combination between the two has led to many of these deaths. 

If we dive into the data, the statistics show that cocaine and fentanyl-related overdoses account for 63% of total overdose deaths. That number is absolutely staggering, as there are five other drugs in the data. 

According to the Georgia Addiction Center, many of these deaths are linked. In recent years, cocaine has begun to be mixed with synthetic opioids like fentanyl to increase its potency with less product. This has led to a major increase in accidental overdoses due to the excessive amount of fentanyl mixed with the cocaine. 

Furthermore, the usage is getting younger. In 2022, fentanyl overdose death rates per 100,000 was 19.4 for young adults aged 18-25, its largest total recorded. The inexperience leads to more of these accidental overdoses, especially when the drug is cut with fentanyl. 

Cartels have been linked to many of these increases, and the statistics show that major cities are the targets of its distribution. Cartels primarily move with laced cocaine, which greatly increases the harm of the drug. 

The DEA has been vigilant in identifying the problems regarding cartel and drug trafficking in the United States. It is believed that these cartels, specifically the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation Cartels, have routes to smuggle drugs across the border and get them to major cities to distribute. 

Within these major cities, the victims of many of these deaths are from minority groups that have already been displaced by the lack of resources in these big cities. In the black community, the rate of these deaths has increased drastically. 

Between 2013 and 2020, Black males saw an increase of 6,980% in fentanyl overdoses, while black females had a 2,140% increase over those years. Los Angeles, a highly-populated Hispanic city, has the most overdose deaths in 2023. For Hispanic Americans, fatal overdoses from opioids mixed with cocaine rose 729% between 2007 and 2019.

These groups face a higher threat to these overdoses in part to where they’re located and the racial disparities in those areas. 

In the west, Los Angeles is city that is primarily hispanic people. Hispanics account for 49.1 percent of the LA population, compared to 24.3 percent for white people. California had the highest total of overdose deaths in 2023.

Research from Health Affairs shows that when fentanyl first entered the illegal drug market, it did not impact all regions the same. The areas that opened the market for fentanyl and fentanyl-laced drugs were in Eastern urban areas, especially big cities in the midwest and along the east coast.

Black Americans are disproportionately concentrated in these cities. During the early to mid-20th century, millions of Black families fled the deep South because of Jim Crow laws, looking for civil rights protections in big Northern and Eastern cities, like Chicago and New York City. 

Those same laws were basically then integrated in these areas. Redlining and further systematic oppression led these cities to be almost completely segregated, in place and opportunity. These policies forced Black Americans into dense urban areas with fewer economic opportunities, higher policing, and underfunded public services. Fentanyl entered through these same cities, where black Americans are already disproportionately located.

Geography accounted for around 40 percent of the increase in opioid overdose deaths among Black Americans compared to White Americans from 2010 to 2020. 

Out west, these same issues lie with a strong hispanic population in Los Angeles. When Hispanics have historically entered the country, the destination has been places like Dallas, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles, because of the opportunities in these countries. 

Due to the process of immigration and the same lack of opportunity in these dense areas, Hispanics have been oppressed and kicked to the corner, leading them to be more at-risk for drug overdoses. 

Many researchers urge that it is necessary to attack the problem head on in these cities. Targeting these disproportionate neighborhoods in these big cities is the only way to get real change. Programs like Communities That HEAL and Project Lazarus have already shown success in reducing overdose deaths. Expanding these programs further can help minimize overdose deaths that result because of location. 

Fentanyl itself has become the biggest threat. Counterfeit pills, laced cocaine, and other party drugs have found higher and higher quantities of fentanyl within them, which has led to an even further reach. This unpredictability makes reducing harm much harder, especially in these underfunded cities. While the drug market remains unstable, minority groups living in high-risk geographic areas will continue to face an increased level of danger.

        <p>Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50-100 times stronger than heroin or morphine.</p>
        <p>According to the Addiction Group, nearly 9 out of 10 opioid overdose deaths in 2021 involved synthetic opioids like fentanyl. Within different Ethnic communities, the statistics are astounding. Between 2013 and 2020, fentanyl overdose rates for Black males increased by 6,980% and for Black females by 2,140%. Between 2007 and 2019, fatal overdoses among the Latino population involving opioids mixed with cocaine rose 729%, and 4,600% when mixed with meth.
In 2022, fentanyl overdose death rates per 100,000 were:

        <h4>The Rise of Cocaine-Related Deaths</h4>
        <p>Cocaine overdoses have raised in number every single year since 2009.</p>
        <p>According to the Georgia Addiction Center, Cocaine is becoming more and more available in the United States. Furthermore, to increase potency, many cartels are mixing the cocaine with other drugs, like fentanyl, which vastly increases the death toll. Many of these overdoses are accidental because of the quantity of fentanyl, not necessarily the potency of the cocaine itself.</p>
